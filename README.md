react-reddit-client
===================

A simple Reddit client written with [Polymer.js](https://www.polymer-project.org/).
This is a recreation of the
[Montage JS tutorial](http://montagejs.org/docs/tutorial-reddit-client-with-montagejs.html),
and the code here is intentionally similar to make for a good comparison.
